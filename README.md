# Pi-approximator
A P5.js sketch which helps derive the value of Pi
Pi is a mathematical constant which is basically the ratio of a circle's diameter to its circumference. Its exact value is given as 22/7 or 3.14159265359 
This p5 skecth derives the value of Pi with a formula 4 x c/t
where c = number of green points on the circle 
      t = number of blue points outside the circle
The program displays the closest derived value of pi from the time you ran the program. 
It has an accuracy of 7 decimal places!
However it is not 100% accurate because we are not taking in account the stroke weight of the circle and the strokeweight of the point,
